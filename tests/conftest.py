"""Pytest fixtures and rootdir marker + subprocess coverage wiring.

An empty conftest.py at tests/ is the canonical SciTeX
convention (audit-project PS208) — it pins the pytest rootdir.

This module ALSO wires subprocess coverage: any child Python
interpreter spawned during tests (e.g. ``subprocess.run`` smoke
tests, ``jupyter nbconvert --execute``) will report coverage
back to the parent's ``.coverage`` shard.

`os.environ.setdefault` would be a no-op here because pytest-cov has
already set COVERAGE_FILE to a tmp dir by the time conftest is loaded.
See ``05_development_06_subprocess-coverage.md`` for context.
